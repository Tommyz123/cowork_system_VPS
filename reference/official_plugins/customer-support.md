## Skills（5个）

### `customer-escalation`
Package an escalation for engineering, product, or leadership with full context. Use when a bug needs engineering attention beyond normal support, multiple customers report the same issue, a customer is threatening to churn, or an issue has sat unresolved past its SLA.

### `customer-research`
Multi-source research on a customer question or topic with source attribution. Use when a customer asks something you need to look up, investigating whether a bug has been reported before, checking what was previously told to a specific account, or gathering background before drafting a response.

### `draft-response`
Draft a professional customer-facing response tailored to the situation and relationship. Use when answering a product question, responding to an escalation or outage, delivering bad news like a delay or won't-fix, declining a feature request, or replying to a billing issue.

### `kb-article`
Draft a knowledge base article from a resolved issue or common question. Use when a ticket resolution is worth documenting for self-service, the same question keeps coming up, a workaround needs to be published, or a known issue should be communicated to customers.

### `ticket-triage`
Triage and prioritize a support ticket or customer issue. Use when a new ticket comes in and needs categorization, assigning P1-P4 priority, deciding which team should handle it, or checking whether it's a duplicate or known issue before routing.
